This document outlines the currently approved templates for bare metal servers within the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, focusing specifically on network connectivity. We will not be discussing storage connectivity that directly attaches to servers.

Bare Metal Server Types
In APAC, we utilize two primary types of bare metal servers based on their network port configurations:

Two-Port Bare Metal Servers: These are standard bare metal servers that do not have cluster capabilities.

Four-Port Bare Metal Servers: These servers are designed for cluster configurations and are referred to as "cluster servers."

Network Connectivity
Two-Port Bare Metal Servers (Normal Servers)
Production Connectivity: These servers are equipped with two production ports.

Network Connection: Both production ports will be connected to the production network, specifically to a production VLAN.

No Cluster Connectivity: These servers do not have any provisions for cluster-specific network connectivity.

Four-Port Bare Metal Servers (Cluster Servers)
Production Connectivity: Two of the four ports will be connected to a production VLAN, similar to the two-port servers.

Cluster Connectivity: The remaining two ports will be dedicated to cluster connectivity. These ports will be connected to a cluster VLAN, which operates at Layer 2. This cluster VLAN is also referred to as a heartbeat VLAN.

General Network Design Principles
Baronet VLANs: It is crucial to note that all bare metal servers connected to the same pair of network switches will utilize the same "baronet" VLAN for their primary connectivity.

Access Ports: As per the requirements from the server team, there is no need for Port Channel or LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) configurations for bare metal server interfaces. Consequently, all interfaces connected to bare metal servers will be configured as access ports.

Template-Driven Automation: Any requirement for a new type of connectivity or an additional VLAN necessitates the creation of a new server template. This also implies that an automation-related change will be required to provision and manage such new configurations.
