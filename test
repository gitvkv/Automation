Slide 1: Current State - Legacy Network
Title: Legacy Network with Old Services
Visual: Diagram showing old servers connected to the legacy network
Key Points:

All services currently run on old servers connected to the legacy network

No GNC (Global Network Connectivity) infrastructure in place

Slide 2: Onboarding LCM Servers
Title: Onboarding Life Cycle Management (LCM) Servers
Visual: LCM servers connected to legacy network with arrows showing vMotion from old servers
Key Points:

New LCM servers deployed in legacy network

Virtual machines (VMs) are being migrated (vMotion) from old to new LCM servers

Ensures continuity while preparing for infrastructure transition

Slide 3: Build Phase 1 - Cloud Rack Setup
Title: Build Phase 1 – Cloud Rack & Arista Switch Installation
Visual: Cloud rack with 4 switches; 2 connected to legacy network, 2 to GNC
Key Points:

New cloud rack built for migration servers

4 Arista switches installed:

2 uplinked to legacy network

2 uplinked to GNC network

Provides dual-path support during migration

Slide 4: Server Deployment with GNC Standards
Title: New Server Deployment with GNC Standards
Visual: Servers connected to legacy-side switches in cloud rack
Key Points:

New servers follow GNC cabling/port standards (e.g., 4 x 10/25G)

These servers still connected via legacy uplinked switches

Acts as an interim step before GNC cutover

Slide 5: vMotion to New Servers in Cloud Rack
Title: Migrating VMs to New Cloud Rack Servers
Visual: Arrows showing vMotion from LCM servers (legacy side) to new cloud rack servers
Key Points:

VM migration from LCM servers to GNC-standard servers in cloud rack

Connectivity still via legacy uplinks

Prepares servers for GNC network transition

Slide 6: Decommissioning Legacy Servers
Title: Decommissioning of Legacy-Connected Servers
Visual: Strikethrough on legacy servers or "Decommissioned" label
Key Points:

All VMs fully migrated

Old servers and switches connected to legacy network decommissioned

Frees up infrastructure and reduces overhead

Slide 7: Big Bang Migration Day
Title: Final Cutover to GNC Network
Visual: Server uplinks moved from legacy-connected switches to GNC-connected switches
Key Points:

GNC switches now become primary path

All servers now part of new GNC network

Legacy network dependency removed

Slide 8: Alternate Option – Switch Uplink Change
Title: Alternative Approach: Uplink Switch Conversion
Visual: Same switches reconnected from legacy to GNC uplinks
Key Points:

Instead of moving server connections, re-uplink existing switches to GNC

Servers remain physically connected to the same switches

Requires switch reconfiguration to support GNC policies

Less disruption, no change to server cabling

Summary Slide (Optional)
Title: Migration Strategy Summary
Bullet Points:

Step-by-step staged migration from legacy to GNC network

Minimal downtime due to phased approach

Option A: Big Bang Cutover via new switch set

Option B: Reuse switches with uplink change for simplified migration
