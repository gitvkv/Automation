Changing the IP address of a VM server, especially in a production environment, must be done carefully to avoid outages, security issues, or application downtime. Hereâ€™s a structured breakdown of **steps** and **key considerations** to ensure a safe transition.

## ðŸ”§ Steps to Change IP Address on a VM Server

### 1. **Pre-Change Validation and Planning**

* **Review current network design**: VLANs, subnets, gateways, DNS, routing.
* **Determine new IP**: Ensure it's within correct subnet and not in use (IPAM check).
* **Understand dependencies**:

  * Applications (hardcoded IPs?)
  * Firewall rules
  * DNS records (A/AAAA, PTR)
  * Load balancers
  * Monitoring tools
  * Backup jobs or replication
  * Configuration management tools (like Ansible, Puppet)

---

### 2. **Take Backups and Snapshots**

* **VM snapshot** (if possible)
* Backup important config files and application data

---

### 3. **Schedule a Maintenance Window**

* Inform stakeholders
* Ensure business approval
* Align with change management processes (if ITIL or similar followed)

---

### 4. **Update DNS and Other Records in Advance**

* Modify or create DNS records (if you plan to use FQDN)
* Update monitoring, CMDB, inventory tools

---

### 5. **Change the IP Address**

* OS level config:

  * **Linux**: `/etc/netplan/`, `/etc/network/interfaces`, `nmcli`, or `ip` depending on distro
  * **Windows**: `ncpa.cpl` or PowerShell (`Set-NetIPAddress`)
* Update the default gateway if needed
* Update `/etc/hosts` or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (optional)

---

### 6. **Restart Network Service / Reboot (if needed)**

* Restart networking (`systemctl restart network`, `netplan apply`, etc.)
* Confirm IP with `ip a`, `ifconfig`, or `ipconfig`

---

### 7. **Validate and Test**

* Ping the gateway
* DNS resolution
* Access application/web UI/SSH/RDP
* Check logs for anomalies
* Validate firewall logs and monitoring alerts

---

### 8. **Update Firewalls / Security Groups**

* If you're using cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure), update SGs
* On-prem: update ACLs/firewalls with new IP

---

### 9. **Update Documentation**

* CMDB, Visio/network diagram, IPAM, Confluence, etc.

## ðŸ§  Key Considerations in Production Environments

| Area                         | Things to Consider                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application Impact**       | Applications that bind to IPs may need reconfiguration                                |
| **Hardcoded IPs**            | Scripts, DB config files, app settings, integration endpoints                         |
| **Firewall Rules**           | Egress/ingress traffic may be blocked after change                                    |
| **DNS TTL**                  | Lower DNS TTL temporarily to allow faster propagation                                 |
| **Monitoring/Alerting**      | Update monitoring tools (Zabbix, Prometheus, etc.) with new IP                        |
| **Backups and Replications** | Ensure backup systems can reach the server post-change                                |
| **Cluster Membership**       | If VM is part of a cluster (K8s, DB clusters), IP change may break trust or heartbeat |
| **Automation**               | Ansible inventory, CI/CD pipelines might need IP update                               |
| **Routing**                  | Confirm routes and gateway connectivity post-IP change                                |
| **Security Tools**           | Update IP in firewall, WAF, SIEM, etc. if applicable                                  |

## âœ… Post-Change Checklist

* [ ] Can reach the server via new IP
* [ ] All apps running and accessible
* [ ] DNS name resolving correctly
* [ ] Monitoring tools showing green
* [ ] No firewall or connectivity issues
* [ ] Change documented and closed properly

Let me know your environment details (Linux/Windows, on-prem/cloud, etc.) if you want commands or a tailored runbook.
