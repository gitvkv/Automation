Arista CVP Global Management: Enhanced Resilience & Operations
Executive Summary
We propose a two-headed Arista CloudVision Portal (CVP) solution with clusters in Singapore (Primary) and Japan (Standby). This will centralize network provisioning and telemetry for all remote sites, significantly boosting efficiency. The Japan cluster ensures continuous telemetry during a Singapore outage, mirroring our proven USA deployment model.

The Solution: Global CVP Deployment
 0 Singapore CVP (Primary): Full management – provisioning, configuration, and telemetry for all remote sites.
 0 Japan CVP (Standby): Telemetry-only – critical for continuous network monitoring if Singapore fails.
Why This Matters (Key Benefits)
 0 Boosted Efficiency: Centralized management streamlines operations, accelerating deployments and reducing errors.
 0 Enhanced Resilience: Ensures critical network visibility (telemetry) even during a primary management site outage.
 0 Proven & Scalable: Based on our successful USA model, ready for global growth.

Key Consideration & Future Outlook
 0 Current Provisioning Limitation: During a Singapore CVP outage, new device provisioning and configuration changes will not be possible from the Japan cluster.
   0 Reason: This is a current limitation of the certified CVP code.
   0 Future Outlook: Provisioning capability via the standby cluster will be evaluated during future CVP certification efforts.

Recommendation
Approve this CVP solution to enhance global network management, resilience, and operational efficiency.
