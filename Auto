This migration initiative aims to transition cloud services from the legacy network infrastructure to the new GNC (Global Network Connectivity) network to improve scalability, performance, and long-term sustainability. As part of this strategy, we have evaluated three primary migration options, each offering distinct advantages and trade-offs based on technical feasibility, risk, downtime, and operational impact.

Migration Options:
vMotion with New IP Address:

Low infrastructure risk

High impact on application and firewall configurations

Suitable for phased, application-by-application migration

Requires significant coordination with service owners

vMotion with Same IP (Legacy ↔ GNC Connectivity):

Retains existing IPs, reducing app changes

Requires bridging legacy and GNC networks for extended periods

High infrastructure risk and operational complexity

Not validated in all environments (e.g., U.S.), limited rollback ability

Big Bang Migration with Same IP:

One-time coordinated cutover with full infrastructure shift

Requires 6–8 hours downtime and extensive testing

Easier rollback plan

High level of stakeholder coordination and approval required

Key Considerations:
IP address retention needs

Acceptable downtime window

Operational and regulatory constraints

Risk tolerance regarding legacy-GNC bridging

Stakeholder readiness and sign-off

Next Steps:
Review all three options with technical teams and application owners

Confirm migration requirements (IP change, downtime, regulatory needs)

Select preferred option based on risk assessment and business impact

Finalize migration timeline, rollback plan, and stakeholder approvals


Slide Title: Migration Strategy Overview
Subheading: Migrating Cloud Services from Legacy Network to GNC Network
Visual Suggestion: Flowchart showing the 3 migration options branching from a central "Legacy Network" node

Slide 1: Option 1 – vMotion + New IP Address
Title: Option 1 – vMotion to GNC with New IP
Visual: VM moving from legacy to GNC network, IP address changing
Key Points:

VMs are migrated to the GNC network using vMotion

New IP address is assigned to each VM

Pros:

Simple from a network architecture perspective

Low risk due to application-by-application approach

Cons:

Application and service owners need to update DNS, firewall rules, configs

Time-consuming due to coordination and testing

Longer overall migration window

Slide 2: Option 2 – vMotion + Same IP (Dual Network Connectivity)
Title: Option 2 – vMotion with Same IP (Legacy ↔ GNC Connectivity)
Visual: Arrows showing VMs keeping same IP while spanning both networks
Key Points:

VMs move from legacy to GNC infrastructure

Same IP address is retained

Requires legacy ↔ GNC L2/L3 connectivity

Pros:

Keeps same IP address (less impact for app owners)

Allows slow, phased migration

Cons:

High infrastructure risk due to legacy equipment

Not tested in some geographies (e.g., US)

Extending broadcast domains = increased instability

Difficult rollback and troubleshooting

Operational complexity

Slide 3: Option 3 – Big Bang Physical + Virtual Server Migration
Title: Option 3 – Big Bang Migration (Same IP)
Visual: Physical and virtual servers being moved in one large cutover window
Key Points:

Physical and virtual servers are migrated in a single event

Servers retain the same IP addresses

All systems must be shut down prior to migration

Pros:

Clean migration with well-defined rollback path

No extended legacy-to-GNC bridging

Cons:

Requires 6–8 hours of planned downtime

Challenging to get approvals from all app owners

Might involve regulatory notifications and extensive UAT

High coordination effort

Not suitable for incremental/phased approach

Slide 4: Migration Approach Considerations
Title: Key Considerations Before Finalizing Migration Option
Visual: Checklist or decision matrix
Bullet Points:

Level of risk tolerance (infrastructure vs application)

Downtime approvals and maintenance windows

Requirement to retain IP addresses

Operational complexity and supportability

Rollback capabilities

Regulatory and UAT requirements

Final decision requires full stakeholder awareness and documented sign-off

Slide 5: Recommendation (Optional)
If you're ready to suggest a preferred path:

Title: Recommended Migration Path (Based on Risk/Complexity Analysis)
Options:

Choose Option 1 if simplicity and phased application migration is key, and IP change is acceptable

Choose Option 2 if IP retention is mandatory, but be cautious of high risk and rollback complexity

Choose Option 3 if one-time downtime is manageable, and rollback/clean cutover is a priority
