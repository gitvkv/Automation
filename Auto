## **Cloud Service Migration from Legacy Network to GNC Network**

### **Overview**

As part of our cloud infrastructure modernization efforts, we are undertaking the migration of services from the legacy network to the new GNC (Global Network Connectivity) network. The GNC network offers improved scalability, performance, and operational standardization aligned with modern networking practices. This migration is a critical step toward decommissioning aging infrastructure and ensuring long-term service reliability.

This document outlines three primary migration options considered, including technical approach, benefits, challenges, and associated risks. It also highlights key considerations and next steps required to finalize the migration strategy.

### **Migration Options**

#### **Option 1: vMotion to GNC Network with New IP Address**

This approach involves migrating virtual machines from the legacy network to the GNC network using vMotion while assigning a new IP address to each VM.

**Advantages:**

* Simple and low-risk from a network infrastructure perspective.
* Allows gradual, application-by-application migration.
* No need for prolonged legacy-GNC network bridging.

**Challenges:**

* High effort required from application and service owners to accommodate IP changes.
* Updates needed for DNS records, firewall rules, monitoring systems, and application configurations.
* Longer migration timelines due to increased coordination and validation.

**Risk Level:** Low to Medium
**Rollback Capability:** High
**Operational Complexity:** Moderate

#### **Option 2: vMotion with Same IP Address (Legacy ↔ GNC Connectivity)**

In this method, virtual machines are migrated to the GNC infrastructure while retaining their original IP addresses. This is made possible by establishing L2/L3 connectivity between the legacy and GNC networks.

**Advantages:**

* No IP change required, minimizing application impact.
* Enables phased, gradual migration of services.

**Challenges:**

* Requires legacy and GNC networks to be connected for an extended period.
* Increases operational risk due to the age and instability of the legacy infrastructure.
* Extending the broadcast domain introduces significant technical and security risks.
* This option is untested in some environments (e.g., United States).
* Troubleshooting and rollback are difficult in case of issues.

**Risk Level:** High
**Rollback Capability:** Low
**Operational Complexity:** High

#### **Option 3: Big Bang Migration with Same IP Address**

This option involves a coordinated, large-scale migration of both physical and virtual servers from the legacy network to the GNC network. All workloads are shut down, migrated, and brought back online within a planned outage window.

**Advantages:**

* Clean cutover from legacy to GNC without dual network bridging.
* Same IP addresses can be retained.
* Easier rollback plan compared to Option 2.

**Challenges:**

* Requires a significant downtime window (estimated 6–8 hours).
* Requires shutdown of all workloads during the migration.
* Gaining necessary approvals from all application owners can be time-consuming.
* May require regulatory notifications and extensive UAT testing.

**Risk Level:** Medium
**Rollback Capability:** High
**Operational Complexity:** High

---

### **Key Considerations for Finalizing Migration Strategy**

* **IP Address Impact:** Does the application require IP retention? If not, Option 1 may be ideal.
* **Downtime Tolerance:** Can applications tolerate 6–8 hours of downtime for a clean migration?
* **Infrastructure Risk:** Is the team willing to bridge the legacy and GNC networks for an extended period (Option 2)?
* **Operational Readiness:** Are teams equipped to handle the complexity of rollback and troubleshooting during partial migrations?
* **Stakeholder Alignment:** Have all application, business, and regulatory stakeholders reviewed and approved the proposed approach?
* **Testing & Validation:** Are UAT and rollback plans in place to validate the migration outcome?

### **Recommendation and Next Steps**

Each option presents trade-offs between application complexity, network risk, and operational feasibility. The decision should be guided by the organization’s risk appetite, downtime window, and the need for IP continuity.

**Next Steps:**

1. Present migration options to stakeholders and business owners.
2. Confirm migration constraints (IP retention, downtime allowance, regulatory impact).
3. Select the most suitable migration path through risk assessment and operational readiness.
4. Develop a detailed execution and rollback plan.
5. Obtain formal stakeholder sign-off.
6. Execute pilot migrations before full-scale rollout.
