Handover Checklist Timing:
Currently, engineers have only about 6 hours to accept the handover checklist. This might be tight, especially with some engineers on time off on Fridays. Can we consider sharing the checklist by Thursday, with a confirmation deadline of Friday 2 p.m.?

RMA Process:
As of now, engineers are not actively raising RMAs. Since this is an occasional need, could we document the RMA process and have the standby PM handle it when required?

Document Sharing:
Some documents are currently shared via email. To avoid confusion and improve accessibility, can we move this content to Confluence or SharePoint, and reference links in the checklist rather than relying on email?

Monday Standby Support Call:
In case of issues during Monday standby, I suggest the project manager joins the call promptly to provide support.

Escalation Contact:
If a contact is unreachable, and there's no escalation number available, whom should we reach out to? Is it acceptable to escalate directly to the PM in such cases?

Appreciate your attention to these points. Happy to discuss further if needed
