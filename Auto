1. Identify the Problem Clearly
Understand what task needs automation:

Is it repetitive?

Is it time-consuming or error-prone?

Who are the users?

2. Define the Goal
Set a specific, measurable goal:

Example: "Reduce backup time by 50%" or "Automate daily report generation"

Break the task into steps:

Input → Process → Output

What data is needed?

What triggers the process?

Select based on your environment:

Scripts (Python, PowerShell)

Automation platforms (Ansible, Jenkins, UIPath)

APIs, CLI tools, cloud services

5. Keep It Simple and Modular
Write small, testable units

Avoid hardcoding — use variables/config files

Make it easy to maintain

6. Add Logging and Error Handling
Track successes and failures

Send alerts for issues

Make debugging easy

7. Test Thoroughly
Test with real-world data

Include edge cases

Perform dry runs if needed

8. Make It User-Friendly
Clear documentation

GUI or CLI with helpful prompts

Easy setup and clear instructions

9. Secure the Tool
Avoid storing passwords in plain text

Use role-based access

Keep dependencies up to date

10. Monitor and Improve
Track performance

Gather feedback

Iterate and add features as needed
