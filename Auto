3. 📈 Capacity Planning Notes & Recommendations
Threshold Alerts: Switches nearing >80% utilization: [List IDs or Names]

Expansion Needs: [e.g., Add new ToR for Cloud expansion]

Decommissioned Ports: [Mention if ports were retired or down]

Redundancy Analysis: % of ports used for high availability links

Upcoming Projects Impact: [e.g., New bare metal rack install in Q3]
