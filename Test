The GNC Light solution is designed to provide a streamlined, scalable, and resilient network fabric for small and very small server rooms. Below are the main highlights of this architecture:

Support for 10G and 25G Server Connectivity

Flexible options based on server capabilities and performance requirements.

IP Mobility Across Racks

Seamless host movement without IP address changes, enabling efficient VM or service migration.

Pre-Approved 10G Backbone Templates for Servers

Ensures consistency, simplifies deployments, and reduces configuration errors.

No Manual Changes Permitted

Enforced policy-based deployment using automated tools to maintain compliance and consistency.

Deployment via Network Fabric as a Service (NFaaS)

Simplifies and accelerates provisioning with infrastructure-as-code practices.

Standardized Configuration Across All Switches

Reduces operational overhead and simplifies troubleshooting.

End-of-Row (EoR) Network Design

Optimized for smaller environments where space and cabling are constrained.

Highly Resilient Server Room Infrastructure

Redundant paths and hardware for improved uptime and service availability.

Traffic Segmentation Supported

Enables isolation between different types of traffic, enhancing security and performance.

Faster Deployment Using Pre-Defined Templates

Significantly reduces time-to-deploy for new server rooms.

Enhanced Network Visibility

Centralized monitoring and analytics through integrated telemetry and CVP.

ðŸ”„ Traffic Segmentation in Simcoe and GNC Light
Traffic segmentation is a critical feature in GNC Light that allows for the logical separation of network traffic within the same physical infrastructure. This helps enhance security, streamline management, and improve performance.

Simcoe Core Design: Dual Routing Domains
The Simcoe core (PIC Core) is configured with two primary routing domains:

Control Network (DAN): Used for switch management and CVP/CVA communication.

Common Services Network: Used to deliver shared IT services like DNS, NTP, AD, etc.

GNC Light Segments
GNC Light introduces four main traffic segments, each mapped to a specific function:

SMA Segment (Secure Management Access)

Used for secure access to managed devices and infrastructure.

Network Device Management Segment

Handles traffic related to network device operations, telemetry, and provisioning.

ILO Management Segment

Isolates traffic for Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) interfaces of servers for out-of-band management.

Common Services Segment

Facilitates access to shared services such as time servers, syslog, DNS, and other internal enterprise tools.
