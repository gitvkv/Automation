This section outlines the network communication flow between  GNC Light switches and the global enterprise network, focusing on management VLANs, routing behaviour, and regional firewall design.
•	The management interfaces of the  GNC Light switches are configured in:
o	VLAN 1000 and
o	VLAN 1002
•	Both VLANs are ultimately routed to the Control Network of the WAN routers.
Control Network Isolation
•	The Control Network of WAN routers is not directly accessible from the global network.
•	To ensure secure communication, traffic between the global network and the GNC Light Control Network must pass through designated firewalls.
 Firewall Path and Regional Routing Strategy
•	Dedicated firewalls in both Singapore (primary) and Japan (secondary) handle this traffic:
o	All communication from GNC Light server rooms to the global network follows a default route pointing to the Singapore region (primary headend).
o	The Control Network subnets advertised from Singapore are preferred globally because:
	BGP AS path prepending is applied to the routes advertised from Japan.
	This causes the Singapore path to appear as the shorter, more optimal route.
Communication Between  GNC Light Switches and CVP
•	The CVP services are hosted in both Singapore and Japan, and their Control Network subnets are:
o	Advertised to the CCCC Control Network
o	Made reachable via the AAR routers in the GNC Light infrastructure
•	As a result:
o	Communication from GNC Light management switches to the respective CVP clusters is direct and doesn't require default route.
o	This ensures low latency and high resiliency for switch provisioning, telemetry, and configuration sync.
