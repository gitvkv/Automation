Mid-Year Performance Review – Mr. Alec

Overview: Mr. Alec, a senior network engineer in our team, has continued to deliver to a high standard and has made a strong impact, especially in the short period since transitioning from contractor to a full-time employee. Within just three months in his permanent role, Alec has quickly reaffirmed his value to the team by executing key infrastructure projects and contributing to BAU stability.

Currently contributing to the Hong Kong HK5P server room modernization, which leverages the same Agora Lite framework. His involvement is helping to advance the modernization of legacy infrastructure.

Actively supports business-as-usual (BAU) activities and works collaboratively with peers to manage ongoing operational tasks.

Engaged in capacity planning efforts to align our infrastructure with upcoming demands, ensuring the platform can scale as needed.

Demonstrated consistent coordination across internal teams and partners, showing initiative in areas beyond his direct assignments.

Increase involvement in lifecycle management planning and coordination to support the transition of this responsibility to the internal hosting team.

Enhance focus on software and hardware currency, ensuring timely refresh and decommissioning of aging network devices.

Maintain active contribution to capacity planning to ensure readiness for future infrastructure requirements.

Overall Assessment: Mr. Alec has made a solid contribution in the first half of the year, both in terms of project delivery and operational support. His performance reflects deep technical capability, reliability, and strong alignment with the team’s strategic goals. As we raise the bar in the second half of the year, I expect Alec to continue driving delivery excellence, support key initiatives like lifecycle management and infrastructure modernization, and take a proactive role in ensuring our platforms remain scalable, modern, and resilient.
